This project, led by Prof. Peter Doerschuk at Cornell University, in collaboration with Northeastern University, Bot Factory, and Geegah LLC, focuses on optimizing Flexible Hybrid Electronics (FHE) printing using advanced AI models and ultrasound metrology. The primary goal is to enhance print outcomes, such as predictability and control of printed line widths and thicknesses, by leveraging GHz ultrasonic imaging and AI technologies. The team aims to develop new software modules for image processing and AI/ML models, integrating innovations from industry partners to address the challenges of low yield in printed electronics boards. The project, with a duration of 18 months and a total cost of $898K, involves a comprehensive approach, including designing experiments, constructing databases, and training AI/ML models for image and vector transformations. The initiative also includes the development of new methodologies for measuring critical dimensions in printed electronics and optimizing printing parameters for improved outcomes. This interdisciplinary effort combines expertise in microsystem engineering, ultrasonics, biomedical sensors, and CMOS - MEMS to advance the field of FHE manufacturing.
